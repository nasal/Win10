# Win10
Bored and messing around with XAML and C#.

The "content box" is a ScrollViewer ready to be filled with content. 
The scrollbar is also styled similarly to the one in Windows 10.

## What works
- Minimize
- Maximize / restore (with button)
- Maximize / restore (with double click on the title bar)
- Exit

## What doesn't
- Everything else

## Content
Content (title, header icon (SVG), header text and content) can be set inside the XAML or inside the .cs file.
